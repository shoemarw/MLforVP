# Machine Learning for Value Prediction
Code repo for investigating the use of machine learning techniques for predicting values of load instructions. This work resulted from a project in a graduate level computer architecture course at the College of William and Mary.

USAGE:

To use our ML models launch the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook. Make sure the relevent datasets are in the same directory as the notebooks and the py files.

To generate more datasets use the cpp files on the unzipped trace files from the CVP website.
